## ✨ Features

- **Authentication System:** Secure login flow with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Distinct roles (Admin, Member) dictating UI components and API access.
- **Project & Task Management:** Create projects, organize tasks into boards, and track their lifecycles.
- **Task Status & Priority Updates:** Intuitive Kanban-style or list-style tracking for "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", and "Done".
- **Dynamic Overdue Task Logic:** Automatic detection and visual highlighting of tasks past their due date.
- **Dashboard Analytics:** High-level metrics for quick insights into workspace progress and user workload.
- **Responsive Frontend UI:** Fluid, adaptive design supporting both desktop and mobile layouts.
- **Filtering, Searching & Sorting:** Advanced capabilities to quickly find the exact task or project needed.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

Team Task Manager is built as a decoupled monolith consisting of a modern React single-page application (SPA) frontend and a robust Node.js/Express REST API backend. 
- The **Frontend** utilizes modular, reusable UI components and a responsive sidebar layout.
- The **Backend** provides secure routes validated via Zod, interacting seamlessly with PostgreSQL through Prisma ORM. 
- Deployment is split across Vercel (Frontend) and Railway (Backend), connected via environment-configured API endpoints.

## 🗄 Database Relationships

The PostgreSQL database (managed via Prisma) centers around several core entities:
- **User:** Can be assigned a Role (`ADMIN` or `MEMBER`). Users can own projects and be assigned to tasks.
- **Project:** Contains multiple Tasks. Owned by an Admin.
- **Task:** Belongs to a single Project. Assigned to a User. Has specific statuses (`TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `REVIEW`, `DONE`) and priorities (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`).

---

## 🔐 Authentication & RBAC Flow

1. **Login:** Users submit credentials; the backend validates and returns a JWT.
2. **Session Persistence:** The frontend stores the JWT and attaches it to the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header of all subsequent Axios requests.
3. **Role-Based Access (RBAC):**
   - **Frontend:** Dynamically renders UI components. Admins see project creation/management tools; Members see execution-focused views.
   - **Backend:** Auth middleware verifies the JWT. RBAC middleware restricts sensitive routes (e.g., `POST /projects`) strictly to Admins.

---

## 💻 Frontend Features

- **Modular UI Components:** Independent, reusable design tokens (Badges, Inputs, Modals).
- **Responsive Sidebar Navigation:** Collapses smoothly on mobile devices for optimal viewing.
- **Project Task Boards:** Interactive UI for tracking task statuses dynamically.
- **Admin/Member Dashboards:** Context-aware homepages displaying tailored metrics.

---

## ⚙️ Backend Features

- **Strict Validation:** Incoming requests are parsed and validated strictly using Zod before hitting controllers.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Centralized middleware for catching and formatting API errors securely.
- **Prisma Relations:** Efficient relational querying to fetch nested project, task, and user data simultaneously.

## 🛣 API Routes Overview

| Route | Method | Access | Description |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | Public | Authenticates user & returns JWT |
| `/api/auth/me` | GET | Authenticated | Returns current user profile |
| `/api/projects` | GET | Authenticated | Lists all projects |
| `/api/projects` | POST | Admin | Creates a new project |
| `/api/tasks` | GET | Authenticated | Lists tasks (supports query filtering) |
| `/api/tasks/:id` | PATCH | Authenticated | Updates task status/details |

---

## ⏱ Overdue Task Logic Explanation

Overdue calculation is handled dynamically. The backend stores the `dueDate` as a UTC timestamp. 
When fetching tasks, the frontend or backend compares the current timestamp against the `dueDate`. If `current_date > due_date` and the task status is not `DONE`, the task is immediately flagged as **Overdue**. The frontend UI reflects this using striking visual cues (e.g., red badges and alerts) to ensure urgent items are addressed.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

### Frontend (`client/.env`)
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### Backend (`server/.env`)
```env
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/team_task_manager?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key"
```

## 🚀 Local Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL installed and running
- npm or yarn

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env # Ensure DATABASE_URL is correct

# Generate Prisma Client and apply migrations
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Start the backend server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env # Ensure VITE_API_URL points to backend

# Start the frontend server
npm run dev
```

## 🛢 Prisma Commands Reference

- `npx prisma studio`: Opens a visual database editor.
- `npx prisma generate`: Re-generates the Prisma Client after schema changes.
- `npx prisma migrate dev`: Creates and applies database migrations.

## 📦 Production Build Steps

1. Navigate to `server` and run `npm run build`. This generates the `dist/` directory.
2. Navigate to `client` and run `npm run build`. This generates the `dist/` directory containing static assets.
